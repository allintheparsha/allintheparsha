## Purpose

### *In a line*
To give more control of the initial steps of the shidduch process to those in the parsha, and decrease reliance on shadchanim for suggestions.

### *In more detail*
Those in the parsha (TITP) are mostly reliant on others to present them with shidduch suggestions. This is disadvantageous to those the system is designed to help in the first place. A principle assumption of this project is that **every** step of the shidduch process should be primarily to help those in the parsha, not significant others such as shadchanim or family members. Therfore, this first step of the shidduch process in which currently TITP are effectively powerless and dependent on external intervention should be reimagined.
Often, TITP go some time with no suggestions, not because there are no valid ones, but because those who have the resumes are either not thinking of them, don't think of that suggestion or worst of all, decide for themselves that an idea isn't worthy of suggesting - sometimes correctly, sometimes not.
If the pool of resumes were freely available to TITP, the friction/latency at this stage of the process would be greatly reduced. TITP could actively research, find and pursue ideas, with only them acting as initial gatekeepers.



## How?

This project's goal is to create a platform for those in the parsha to find relevant resumes, and pass them on to the next stage of the process.
This will be achieved by those looking for resumes first uploading their own. This will grant them access to the database, which they will be able to search and filter. Any resumes deemed relevant can be downloaded, emailed or printed, individually or in bulk.

## Potential Problems

Such as system is ripe for abuse. Users will attempt to upload fake profiles in order to access the database without submitting private information. It is vital to the health of the system to eliminate such 'lurking', as the benefit of the system expands with scale, which can only be acheived through reciprocity.

## How to contribute

This project is built on Node.js, using ExpressJS, Pug, and Bootstrap.
